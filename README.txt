Q1: If we have a single-core, uniprocessor system that supports multiprogramming, how many
processes can be in a running state in such a system, at any given time?

A1: In this scenario, we can only have one process in the running state. That is because we only have one core,
(a core has registers, ALU, control unit) and thus just enough CPU components for operating a single proccess.
But multiprogramming is supported with the help of scheduling (scheduling algorithms) and context switching.
We would simply implement a scheduling algorithms which would switch between different processes. For example,
we can use round-robin to switch between process A and process B quickly enough to have good response time and
see progress with both processes.


Q2: Explain why system calls are needed for a shared memory method of inter-process
communication (IPC). If there are multiple threads in one process, are the system calls needed
for sharing memory between those threads?

A2: System calls are needed for a shared memory method of inter-process communication (IPC) because shared memory 
involves the coordination of access to a shared resource between multiple processes, which requires the involvement 
of the operating system. System calls are the mechanism through which a user-level process can interact with the 
operating system and request services like allocating shared memory, mapping it into its address space, and synchronizing 
access to it.

When two or more processes want to communicate using shared memory, they need to agree on the location and size of the 
shared memory segment, which requires the use of system calls like shmget() to allocate the shared memory and shmat() 
to map it into the address space of each participating process. Once the shared memory is set up, the processes need 
to coordinate access to it to avoid conflicts and race conditions, which requires the use of synchronization primitives 
like semaphores, which can be obtained through system calls like sem_init() and sem_wait().

In the case of multiple threads within a single process, system calls are not strictly necessary for sharing memory between 
those threads, as they all share the same address space and can access the same memory directly. However, synchronization 
primitives like mutexes and condition variables may still be needed to coordinate access to shared memory between multiple 
threads to avoid race conditions and ensure consistency. These synchronization primitives can also be obtained through system 
calls like pthread_mutex_init() and pthread_cond_wait().

An outline of what we did for the assignment:
For this assignment, we implemented a simple shell program which can perform a few simple commands, and interact with files.
During our assignment we conducted reasearch about how to implement a shell, about the commands we were assigned to implement,
and went through many versions of our project, until we perfected it. We also implemented the fork(), wait(), exec(), clone() and execle(), 
which also helped us to understand these commands better and the way proccesses are created. And additionally, we implemented and reasearched the
forkbomb, which we (of course) didn't execute but do understand how it works.

Instructions for compiling:
The executables for the shell and the commands (wc, grep, df, cmatrix) are included within the .zip file, so the user doesn't need to compile
anything for the shell to be working. The user just needs to be in the same directory in terminal as the executables, and (of course), the executables
must be all at the same location. In the terminal, just type in './shell' and the shell program is runned and ready for use.
If the user wishes to execute the additional taks 3 programs, they need to compile the C files, and then run them (gcc -o <NAME> <FILE NAME>.c -Wall).

Any sources/tutorials you have used to complete the assignment:
The sources we used for this assigned are: man pages, google (googling commands not featured in Mac OS man pages and implementations of the assigned commands),
ChatGPT

Any challenges you encountered along the way:
This assigned was challaning in a way that made us go into details for each implementation. The basics such as: prompt and shell colours didn't impose a challange
such as the implementation of the assigned commands and system calls, since it required us to actually reasearch and understand the commands/ system calls.
